# Project_capstone : Building a Student Intervention System

# Introduction
This project is focused on the development of a Student Intervention System using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate.

# Project Overview
Educational institutions often face challenges in identifying students who require intervention to improve their academic performance. This project aims to build a predictive model that can flag students at risk of not completing their course.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various student performance metrics from a high school. It contains both demographic and academic performance data points.

# Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Jupyter Notebook

# Models Evaluated
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier

# Model Selection and Evaluation
After an exploratory data analysis and preprocessing phase, we trained and evaluated the three models. Each model was assessed based on the F1 score, considering both training and testing datasets to ensure a robust evaluation.

# Optimizing the Best Model
The model with the highest F1 score on the testing dataset was selected. We performed grid search optimization to fine-tune the model parameters, aiming to improve the performance further.

# Results
The final tuned model showed improved F1 scores, indicating better performance in identifying students who require intervention.
